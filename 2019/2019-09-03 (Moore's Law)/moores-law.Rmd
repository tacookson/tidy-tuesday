Who has designed the most types of CPUs over time?

```{r}
cpu %>%
  filter(year_introduced < 2019) %>%
  mutate(designer = fct_lump(designer, 5),
         year_introduced_binned = year_introduced %/% 5 * 5) %>%
  count(year_introduced_binned, designer) %>%
  mutate(designer = fct_reorder(designer, n, sum)) %>%

       x = "Year introduced",

How have the number of transistors changed over time?

```{r}
cpu %>%
  mutate(designer = fct_lump(designer, 5)) %>%
  group_by(year_introduced, designer) %>%
  summarise(avg_transistor_count = mean(transistor_count, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_introduced, y = avg_transistor_count)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ designer) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma_format())
```

What is the relationship between number of transistors and size of the manufacturing process?

```{r}
library(plotly)

p <- cpu %>%
  mutate(designer = fct_lump(designer, 5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mftg_process_nm, y = transistor_count, col = year_introduced)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste("processor_name:", processor)), size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = comma_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = comma_format()) +

       x = "Size of manufacturing process (nanometres)",
       y = "Transistor count",
       col = "Year introduced")

How many transistors can we fit on a square millimetre of CPU board?

```{r}
cpu %>%
  mutate(transistors_per_mm = transistor_count / area_mm,
         designer = fct_lump(designer, 5)) %>%
  group_by(year = year_introduced %/% 5 * 5,
           designer) %>%
  summarise(avg_transistors_per_mm = mean(transistors_per_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_transistors_per_mm, col = designer)) +
