# Preliminary questions

* What is a typical winning lift weight for each event?
* Does that weight change over time?
* What impact does age have on lift weight?
* What impact does body weight have on lift weight?
* What impact does sex have on lift weight?
* How have individual weightlifters progressed over their careers? (related: is there peak age?)
* Who are the youngest and oldest weightlifters?
* Is there anything unusual among weightlifters who were disqualified for doping?
* Can we create a simple predictor of how an individual weightlifter will place, given their history?

                                event == "BD" ~ "Ironman / Push-Pull",

                                event == "S" ~ "Squat",
                                event == "B" ~ "Bench",
                                event == "D" ~ "Deadlift"),
         dob_approx = date - years(floor(age))) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(dob_approx = mean(dob_approx, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(age_approx = decimal_date(date) - decimal_date(dob_approx),
         age = ifelse(is.na(age), floor(age_approx), floor(age))) %>%
  select(-dob_approx, -age_approx, -federation)
```

Can we interpolate age based on age from other categories?

```{r}

         category = str_remove_all(category, "_kg"),
         category = str_to_title(category),
         equipment = fct_reorder(equipment, best_lift_kg, max)) %>%
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, best_lift_kg, col = equipment, shape = equipment)) +

```

Preliminary linear models

```{r}
ipf_lifts %>%
  filter(best3bench_kg > 0,
         !is.na(bodyweight_kg),
         !is.na(age)) %>%
  lm(best3bench_kg ~ sex + bodyweight_kg, data = .) %>%
  summary()
```
